Preventing Problems with Julia :)

My code works, but its not stress tested/ doesnt prevent people from doing something wrong. 

We need some checks that prevent incorrect file upload. 

we already check that Lat/lng is in the correct place, and goes to the correct file type. 


1) How do we make it so if a pod already exists, New pod flags, instead of creatin a pod over the existing one. 
    Look through the JSON file, with all of the Lat/Lng's
